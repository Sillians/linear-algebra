## **Reducing a Quadratic Curve to Its Principal Axes**

Reducing a quadratic curve to its **principal axes** is a powerful technique that transforms a general 
conic section into its standard form. This process involves diagonalizing the quadratic part of the curve,
removing cross-product terms (like $`xy`$) via a change of variables (rotation), and aligning the coordinate 
axes with the directions of the curve's principal axes.

### **1. Identifying a Quadratic Plane Curve**

A general quadratic plane curve is described by the second-degree equation:

$`Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0`$

This equation defines conic sections like ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas depending on the values of the coefficients.

### **2. Reducing the Curve Using Principal Axes**

To simplify this curve, we eliminate the cross term $`Bxy`$ by rotating the coordinate system. 
This involves the following steps:

#### Step 1: Form the symmetric matrix of the quadratic part

Let:

$`Q = \begin{bmatrix} A & \frac{B}{2} \\\frac{B}{2} & C \end{bmatrix}`$


#### Step 2: Diagonalize the matrix $`Q`$

Find the **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors** of $`Q`$. These eigenvectors define the directions of the **principal axes**, 
and the eigenvalues correspond to the coefficients of the new squared variables.

### **3. Finding the Principal Axes of a Quadratic Plane Curve**

The principal axes are the eigenvectors of the matrix $`Q`$. If the eigenvalues are:

$`\lambda_1, \lambda_2`$


Then a change of variables using the eigenvectors transforms the quadratic form:

$`\mathbf{x}^T Q \mathbf{x}`$


into:

$`\lambda_1 u^2 + \lambda_2 v^2`$

This is the rotated form of the conic, aligned with the principal axes.

### **4. Finding the Principal Axes Given Eigenvalues**

Given the eigenvalues $`\lambda_1`$ and $`\lambda_2`$ of the matrix $`Q`$, the principal axes are the corresponding **eigenvectors**, 
which determine the **direction** of rotation. Using these, construct a **rotation matrix** $`P`$:


$`P = [\mathbf{v}_1 \ \mathbf{v}_2]`$


Then perform the change of variables:


$`\begin{bmatrix} x \\y \end{bmatrix} = P \begin{bmatrix} u \\v \end{bmatrix}`$


This rotates the original conic section so that its axes align with the standard coordinate axes.

### **5. Identifying the Principal Axes Using a Diagram**

When given a diagram of a conic section (e.g., an ellipse or hyperbola):

* The **principal axes** are the lines passing through the center of the curve, aligned with the longest and shortest directions of the curve (for ellipses) or asymptotes (for hyperbolas).


* These axes are orthogonal if the conic is rotated but not sheared.


* You can visually identify them by locating the orientation of the curve and noting the directions where the curve exhibits **maximum** and **minimum** curvature.
